## Dependencies

### What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

This particulator geneartor also requires the [travis-encrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/travis-encrypt) npm module.

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g travis-encrypt
```
